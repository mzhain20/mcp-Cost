# Release History

## 0.7.1 (Unreleased)

### Added

### Breaking Changes

- Redesigned how conditionally required options are handled. Commands now use explicit option registration via extension methods (`.AsRequired()`, `.AsOptional()`) instead of legacy patterns (`UseResourceGroup()`, `RequireResourceGroup()`). [[#452](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/452)]

### Fixed
