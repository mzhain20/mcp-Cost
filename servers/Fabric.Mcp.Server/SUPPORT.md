## How to use the Microsoft Fabric MCP Server

The Microsoft Fabric MCP Server is a comprehensive AI-ready toolkit that provides your AI agents with deep knowledge of Microsoft Fabric APIs, item definitions, and best practices. Build data analytics solutions, author Fabric items, and generate production-ready code directly from VS Code, other coding tools, or AI agents like GitHub Copilot.

Since this is a **local-first server** that runs entirely on your machine, you maintain complete control over your development workflow while giving AI agents the context they need to generate robust, Fabric-compatible code.

## Microsoft Support Policy

The Microsoft Fabric MCP Server is an **open-source project in Public Preview**. Support is provided through community channels and GitHub repositories.

**Community Support (Primary):**
- [GitHub Issues][gh-issue] - Bug reports, feature requests, and questions
- [Microsoft Fabric Community][fabric-community] - Broader Fabric platform questions

**Enterprise Support (Limited):**
Microsoft customers with support agreements may receive assistance with:
- General Microsoft Fabric platform questions
- Fabric REST API documentation and usage guidance
- .NET development and runtime environment issues

> **Note**: Support for the specific MCP Server implementation is primarily through the open-source community channels listed above.

## Public Preview Considerations

As a **Public Preview** project, please note:

- **üîÑ Breaking Changes**: Implementation may change before General Availability
- **üöß Feature Completeness**: Some features are still being developed
- **‚öñÔ∏è Stability**: While functional, the software is still being refined
- **üìö Documentation**: Some documentation may be incomplete or evolving

## Troubleshoot the Fabric MCP Server

If you encounter an unexpected issue while working with the Fabric MCP Server, check out our comprehensive [Troubleshooting Guide][fabric-troubleshooting] for common solutions and diagnostic steps.

**Quick troubleshooting checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ **Verify .NET 9 SDK** is installed: `dotnet --version`
2. ‚úÖ **Check MCP client configuration** syntax and file paths
3. ‚úÖ **Ensure server builds** without errors: `dotnet build`
4. ‚úÖ **Test with simple commands** first to isolate issues
5. ‚úÖ **Check logs** for detailed error information
6. ‚úÖ **Restart your MCP client** after configuration changes
7. ‚úÖ **Verify file permissions** on project directories

**Common Issues:**
- Empty console window (this is normal - server uses stdio)
- .NET 9 runtime not found
- MCP client not detecting tools
- Path resolution problems in configuration
